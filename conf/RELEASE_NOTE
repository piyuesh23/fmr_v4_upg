License : Affero GPL
Copyright : Charles du Jeu 2011
Version number : 4.0.1
Demo : http://ajaxplorer.info/demo

This is a bugfix release.

[New]
+ "Default Role" implementation : like "Default Rights", all newly created users will have this
role.
+ Command-line delegation for both "compress" and multiple "download" actions, using the server
"zip" command.
+ Option for delegating the dowloads to the server, using the X-SendFile server module
(external module to install, available for Apache, Lighttpd & Nginx).

[GUI]
Fix IE7 double click for opening in external window : closing the lightbox too fast was
creating error with the shadower script.
Default double click switch to "download" if no openable editor available.
Typo error onCancel / onComplete function

[Plugins]
[access.fs] Error in readFile was breaking multiple files download in any other browser than
Chrome (wrong headers sent)
[access.dropbox] Missing columns definitions for dropbox plugin / Update dropbox-php for API
1.0, plus patch to skip SSL certificate, plus OAuth negociation at repository initiation.
[conf.sql] Fix conf.sql for templates children
[downloader.http] Move upload>subMenu as a downloader.http override, thus no submenu if this
plugin is not active.
[editor.audio] Wrong tooltip for Volume Button
[access.mysql] Add DEFAULT_RIGHTS option for Mysql driver
[editor.diaporama] Handle "array" config case during serial/deserialization (only applicable in
editor.diaporama until now, was breaking its configuration)
[editor.jumploader] Jumploader old doc was not correctly reported
[log.sql] Forgotten DIBI Require


[Core Auth]
ALLOW_CROSSUSER_SHARING : Do not compare to === true
"guest" user handling when ALLOW_GUEST_BROWSING is not active. Better check for delegate
repository creation, check for errors before creating anything. New method
AuthServide::isReservedUserId() for a future modularization of the "guest" concept.

[Misc]
Fix background action when users are not enabled.
Fix metastore & meta plugin when no user enabled!
Rename default text file and update the content
Fix backgroundPanel style
Ability to transmit directly a javascript instruction to the backgroundManager

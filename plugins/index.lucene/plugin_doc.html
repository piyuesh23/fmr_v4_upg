<p>This plugin uses the Zend_Search_Lucene library that implement the Apache Lucene module in PHP for indexing the files and
providing an efficient search tool. You must make sure to add a meta source "index.lucene" to the repositories that
you want to be indexed.</p>
<p>The plugin supports the indexation of metadata, the background indexation of huge folders (if the framework can be run
in background via the command line), and also the indexation of files contents when they are textual files (TXT, HTML). It
could be possible to add PDF indexation using some pdf-to-text conversion, but it's not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The search results display a "Hit Score" that is provided by the search engine.</p>

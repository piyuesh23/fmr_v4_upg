<p>Connect a Samba share and browse its files and folders. This plugin is based on a php wrapper around the command line tool smbclient. This tool must be installed on the server. The wrapper was first developped by Victor M. Varela. Like the ftp access driver with the auth.ftp, this smb driver can be used in conjunction with the auth.smb plugin to authenticate users directly against the samba share.</p>

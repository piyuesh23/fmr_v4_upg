 * PDF Preview Plugin : How to install?
 */ 
To be able to see PDF previews as jpeg, you must have both ImageMagick and Ghostscript 
(Ghostscript fonts must be there too) installed on your server. 
Once this is done, fill the path to "convert" in the file conf.editor.pdf.inc and move 
this file inside your ajaxplorer installation server/conf/, then rename manifest.xml.default 
to manifest.xml
Beaware that the PHP command will not necessarily take the fact that convert is in the PATH into account
so write the full path to convert.

PLEASE : test your server before posting some "it's not working" in the forum!! in a commandline, 
change to a directory containing a pdf file, let's say myFile.pdf, and execute the following command : 
> [the_path_you_entered_in_conf.editor.pdf.inc] myFile.pdf[0] preview.jpg
So for example, on windows, something like :
> C:\PROGRA~1\ImageMagick\convert.exe myFile.pdf[0] preview.jpg
or on Linux
> /opt/bin/convert myFile.pdf[0] preview.jpg
If it's working ok, then it should be in AjaXplorer too!
